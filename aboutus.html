<p class="about">One of the leading casual dining chains in India, FLAVOR FUSION pioneered the concept of “over the table barbeque” 
live grills embedded in dining tables – allowing guests to grill their own barbecue’s right at their tables.THE FLAVOR FUSION
 was founded in 2006 with the concept of 'all you can eat'. We currently own and operate around 200 outlets in India, 4 
outlets in UAE, 1 outlet in Malaysia and 1 outlet in Oman.Indian cuisine is a natural part of the diet in the markets in which
 the FLAVOR FUSION operate. </p>
<p class="about">We continue to offer new menu options, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian,
 largely based on The Flavor Fusion Indian cuisine and use seasonal customer preferences to introduce new dishes. We also run popular food 
festivals at our , thereby offering our customers a range of Indian and international cuisines.
Our fixed price ‘all you can eat’ concept at our Barbeque Nation Restaurants offers our customers a varying spread of 
consistently delicious food at a value-oriented price in a pleasant and casual dining environment. We believe that 
cuisine is distinctively attractive as compared with other dining options due to its DIY and cooked-at-the-table nature and
 the flexibility and fun of mixing and matching a wide variety of meats, vegetables, sauces and condiments to create dishes 
according to each diner’s individual tastes and preferences. In addition, fixed price dining is very popular amongst relatively
 larger groups, due to customers’ perception of value for money and the comfort of certainty over the bill amount 
irrespective of varying individual appetites and consumption.THE FLAVOR FUSION Restaurants typically offer customers 
at least five vegetarian and five non-vegetarian largely pre-cooked appetisers they can season and barbeque on a grill 
embedded in their table, an all-you-can-eat main course buffet and a selection of desserts</p>
